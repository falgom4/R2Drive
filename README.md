4. If you don't have a bucket yet, create one with the **Create bucket** button
5. To get credentials, go to the **Manage R2 API Tokens** tab
6. Click on **Create new token** and select **R2 API Key Token**
7. Assign a name to the token (for example, "R2Drive Access")
8. Select the necessary permissions (recommended: read and write)
9. Click on **Create API token**
10. Save the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** shown (this will be the only time you can see the Secret Key)

### 2. Configure the .env.local file

```
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id
